Just another respository

Hello,

My name is Tara. I was born and raised in Pensacola. I lived in Tampa, FL for 10 years before relocating back to Pensacola. I am a senior at the University of West Florida. My major is Computer/Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I love to spend time with my 4 yr old Lab, Shadow. I also love to travel.
